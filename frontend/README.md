### Mobile App in Swift

Currently has a gross example proj, that does pull reviews from the feed and render them in a sort of feed-like way. Absolutely nothing I do changes this structure so significant work required before anything else hits the view. But like, you can sort of see reviews lol.

Probably will start over in this dir with a fresh proj and less bullshit.
